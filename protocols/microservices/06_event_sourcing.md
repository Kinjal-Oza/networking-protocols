# Event Sourcing in Microservices

## Overview
Event Sourcing is a pattern where the state of an application is determined by a sequence of events rather than just the current state. Each change to the domain is captured as an event object and these events are stored in the sequence they were applied for the lifetime of the application.

## Technical Details

### Core Components
- Event Store: Persistent storage for all events
- Event: Immutable record of a state change
- Aggregate: Domain entity that maintains its state through events
- Event Handler: Processes events and updates read models
- Snapshot: Point-in-time state capture for performance optimization

### Characteristics
- Complete Audit Trail
- Event Replay Capability
- Temporal Query Support
- State Recreation at Any Point

## Implementation

### Python Example using EventStore

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime
from typing import List, Dict

@dataclass
class Event:
    event_type: str
    data: Dict
    timestamp: datetime
    aggregate_id: str

class EventStore:
    def __init__(self):
        self._events: List[Event] = []
    
    def append_event(self, event: Event):
        self._events.append(event)
    
    def get_events(self, aggregate_id: str) -> List[Event]:
        return [e for e in self._events if e.aggregate_id == aggregate_id]

@dataclass
class Account:
    account_id: str
    balance: float = 0
    
    def apply_event(self, event: Event):
        if event.event_type == "DEPOSIT":
            self.balance += event.data["amount"]
        elif event.event_type == "WITHDRAW":
            self.balance -= event.data["amount"]

class BankingService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.event_store = EventStore()
        
    def deposit(self, account_id: str, amount: float):
        event = Event(
            event_type="DEPOSIT",
            data={"amount": amount},
            timestamp=datetime.now(),
            aggregate_id=account_id
        )
        self.event_store.append_event(event)
        
    def get_account_state(self, account_id: str) -> Account:
        account = Account(account_id)
        events = self.event_store.get_events(account_id)
        for event in events:
            account.apply_event(event)
        return account
```

### Event Store with PostgreSQL

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    aggregate_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    event_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    event_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    version INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE INDEX idx_aggregate_id ON events(aggregate_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_timestamp ON events(timestamp);
```

## Design Considerations

### Architecture Planning
1. Event Schema Design
   - Version events for schema evolution
   - Include metadata for tracking and debugging
   - Define clear event naming conventions

2. Storage Strategy
   - Choose between specialized event stores or traditional databases
   - Consider partitioning for scalability
   - Implement snapshotting for performance

3. Consistency Requirements
   - Define event ordering guarantees
   - Handle concurrent modifications
   - Implement optimistic concurrency control

### Implementation Patterns
1. Event Upcasting
   - Handle event schema evolution
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Version event schemas

2. Snapshotting
   - Determine snapshot frequency
   - Store snapshots alongside events
   - Implement snapshot recreation logic

## Security Implementation

1. Event Integrity
   - Sign events cryptographically
   - Implement event chain validation
   - Prevent event modification

2. Access Control
   - Implement event-level authorization
   - Secure event store access
   - Audit event access patterns

## Best Practices

1. Event Design
   - Keep events immutable
   - Include all necessary context
   - Use meaningful event names
   - Version event schemas

2. Performance Optimization
   - Implement snapshotting
   - Use appropriate indexes
   - Optimize event storage
   - Cache frequently accessed states

3. Monitoring and Debugging
   - Log event processing
   - Track event processing latency
   - Monitor event store health
   - Implement event replay capability
